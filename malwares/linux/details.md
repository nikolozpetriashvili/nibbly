TODO

## 2. /keyloggers/klogger.py && /keyloggers/server.py

A simple keylogger and its remote server for receiving keystroke data. Just a learning project — messing around with Linux input devices, sockets, and low-level stuff.

### TODO

- Make device detection smarter (support more than one keyboard or detect devices dynamically)
- Handle special keys better (Shift, Ctrl, etc.) — smarter key parsing
- Show or save logs on the server side
- Maybe add basic encryption for data transmission
- Try supporting multiple clients at the same time

### Notes

- i would like to build keylogger in c as well
