They can be malicious because:
- HTA scripts run with full system permissions
- Launch programs (calc.exe, notepad.exe)
- Read/write files anywhere the user can access
- Download and execute malicious software
- Modify system settings or registry

JScript = Microsoft’s version of JavaScript, for scripting on Windows.
VBScript = Visual Basic-based scripting language.
Both can be embedded in HTA, .vbs files, or classic ASP pages.
